## Active initiative

None. Last initiative (prod-seed re-run) completed 2026-05-23.

## Recently completed — 2026-05-23

**Buyer-mobile OTP error humanization** (#190 → #191). Verify screen was rendering raw `DioException.toString()` on 401, dumping an 8-line trace + MDN HTTP-docs link + "fix your request code" advice onto the user. Replaced with inline helper that surfaces the API's French `error.message` (e.g. "Code OTP invalide ou expiré"), with status-keyed fallbacks for 400/401/429 and a generic catch-all. Verified on emulator with wrong code → clean one-liner. Helper duplicated four ways now (catalog/checkout/cart + new OTP); a shared-util promotion is a logical next refactor.

**`Run prod seed` workflow** shipped end-to-end. Re-fired prod seed, prod product_images now point at per-product picsum.photos URLs (confirmed via `GET https://api.teka.cd/api/v1/browse/products?limit=1` returning `image.url=https://picsum.photos/seed/<productId>-0/600/600`). Buyer-mobile home screen also visually verified rendering the new picsum images.

PRs in order:
- **#183 → #184** — `Run prod seed` workflow_dispatch action (concurrency-locked, `confirm: RUN` guardrail).
- **#185 → #186** — 3-tier tsx resolver in the workflow (pnpm symlink, raw cli.mjs, or ephemeral global install) after first fire hit `tsx not found` on the prod image.
- **#187 → #188** — seed.ts: prod mode reuses the oldest existing ADMIN row via lookup instead of trying to upsert one (per `docs/deployment.md § 5b`, prod admins are seeded out-of-band; the old `requireInProd` would have either no-op'd or created a duplicate admin on every re-seed). Opt-in via `SEED_INCLUDE_ADMIN=true`.
- **#190 → #191** — buyer-mobile OTP verify error humanization (see above).

## Next candidates surfaced today

- **Local dev seed `ipanga@outlook.fr` collision**. `seedTekaOfficielSeller()` upserts by `User.id` but creates with `email = ipanga@outlook.fr` — collides with any existing user with that email (i.e. the dev's own admin row), making `pnpm db:seed` fail on the platform-seller step. Small targeted fix.
- **Promote `extractApiError(DioException)` to a shared util**. Four copies now (catalog/checkout/cart + OTP).

**Earlier same day:**
- **#181 → #182** — seed change: per-product Picsum URLs + mutable image upsert (so re-seed actually propagates).
- **#179 → #180** — buyer home product card 7px overflow fix.
- **#177 → #178** — buyer home product list sortBy + envelope-parse bugs.

## Buyer push notifications — fully validated 2026-05-22

End-to-end round-trip confirmed on the emulator: login → `POST /v1/users/device-tokens` → backend row → `firebase-admin.messaging().send` from inside the api container → FCM delivery → notification on device. Buyer FCM stack is production-functional for Android (iOS pending).

Shipped 2026-05-21 / 22:
- **#150** (PR A) — backend `DeviceToken` + endpoints + `PushService` + `OrderNotificationService` push fan-out for all 5 buyer order events.
- **#160** (PR A.5) — `PushService` accepts discrete `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` + `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` + `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` env vars (GitHub-Secrets-friendly).
- **#154** — `apk add postgresql-client` in api Dockerfile so manual migrations work via `docker exec`.
- **#155 + #157** — `Apply prod migration` GitHub Action handling `@` in `DATABASE_URL` password.
- **#159** (PR B) — Flutter FCM client + Android config for buyer-mobile.
- **#162** — GoRouter rebuild-on-auth-change fix that was silently breaking OTP login.

Manual migration applied to dev + prod DBs (the `device_tokens` table).

## Pending in the push initiative

- **PR C** — iOS scaffold for both apps (`flutter create --platforms=ios .` per app, GoogleService-Info.plist placement, Push Notifications + Background Modes capabilities). APNs `.p8` already uploaded to Firebase Console (same key for buyer + seller — project-wide auth key).
- **PR D** — CI/CD secret injection. Base64-encode the credential files into GitHub Secrets; deploy workflow writes them to `/home/deploy/teka-rdc/secrets/` at deploy time. Today the gitignored credentials only exist on the operator's Mac.
- **PR C** — iOS scaffold for both apps (`flutter create --platforms=ios .` per app, GoogleService-Info.plist placement, Push Notifications + Background Modes capabilities). APNs `.p8` already uploaded.
- **Remaining PR E work** — stock-alert pushes (needs SKU-threshold schema first) + web push evaluation. Tap-navigation + product-approval/rejection + new-review events already shipped.

## Sentry — DSN still missing

Operator next step: create the Sentry project at sentry.io, paste DSN into `.env.production` on the VPS, restart api. Until then `Sentry.init` is skipped and `captureException` is a no-op. Full walkthrough in `docs/sentry.md` § "First-time setup".

## Next candidates (unrelated to push)

Surfaced by a 2026-05-21 code-rot audit. Not yet picked up.

| # | Candidate | Effort | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Real popularity metric** for `GET /v1/browse/products?sort=popularity` (currently falls back to `createdAt desc`) | M | UX gap — buyers see only newest, no "best-selling" surface. |
| 2 | Mark `AuthProvider.GOOGLE` + retired `PHONE_OTP` paths as `@deprecated` in `packages/shared/src/types/auth.ts` | M | Dead enum members still type-allowed. |
| 3 | Move retired-endpoint e2e tests (`/v1/auth/otp/*`) to `deprecated-e2e.spec.ts` | M | Tests pass but the routes 404 in prod — false confidence. |
| 4 | Bulk Flutter `InputDecoration` border modernization across both mobile apps | S | Not broken, lagging current Material 3 idiom. |

## Recently archived plans

- `~/.claude/plans/archive/partitioned-nibbling-spark.shipped.md` — Rakuten redesign, executed in PRs #67–#73. **Do not re-execute.** Plan files in `~/.claude/plans/archive/` with `.shipped.md` are historical — read for context only.

> Other untouched files in `~/.claude/plans/` (e.g. `calm-soaring-emerson.md`, `fix-ios-push-mighty-nebula.md`) have unknown status. They are not necessarily in-flight — cross-reference against git log + this file before treating one as a backlog item.
